## Description

Repo for the companion app for the board game Black Cat developed for the UNO Innovation Cup 2023

Short summary of the game:

Files strewn across the board which may or may not contain a virus. The players must protect their end point/router/network from the enemy (which is the computer). Certain players have different powers that help you in defending your endpoint.
